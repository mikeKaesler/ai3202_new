-m S ~s is example for marginal, can do any letter S,P,C,X,D

-g is conditional, it must be in correct order from top down in the chart
i.e.
-g x/cs is okay for x given x=t and s=t, but cannot do -g x/sc

-j for joint probabilites, but note, joint probabilites are buggy, only
gives the all caps version -jPSC even though coded for all of them 

also set priors -pP.6 set pollution = low to .6
